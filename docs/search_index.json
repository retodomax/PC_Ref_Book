However it also implies that the files will be stored as linked files which has some disadvantages (see below) Ways to store attachment files Stored Files + If you delete the item, the pdf is also deleted - pdf located within complicated folder name Linked files - If you delete the item in Zotero, you manually need to delete the pdf in the “Location of files” + pdf located in specified folder with configurable folder structure Change between Stored Files and Linked files Luckily this is relatively easy (with ZotFile installed) Go to Tools &gt; ZotFile Preferences... &gt; General Settings &gt; Location of Files Now you can switch between Attach stored copy of file(s) = Stored Files Custom Location = Linked files With custom location also specify Use subfolder defined by /%A/ which will make folders with the first letter of author.
