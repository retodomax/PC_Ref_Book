# Reference management with LaTeX


## Install Biber

On Windows: Powershell --> `tlmgr install biber`
(seems to be NOT automatically installed with package `biblatex`)


## In Texworks

Always run

1. pdflatex
2. biber
3. pdflatex (again)

Or write bash script which runs the comands in this order

## In RStudio

Biber and knitr can make some problems togeter (see [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71565/knitr-and-biblatex))

Easy workarround: use backend bibtex instead of backend biber

`\usepackage[backend=bibtex]{biblatex}`
