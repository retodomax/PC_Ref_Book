# Inkscape

## Latex in Inkscape

* Write formulas with [Textext](https://textext.github.io/textext/)
  - Preamble file: create `package_default.tex` file which contains `\input{RetoMath.sty}` and maybe additional packages for individual projects
* Write text in [CMU Serif]
  - Download the font Computer Modern Unicode (CMU) with `sudo apt-get install fonts-cmu`
* Use `PDF+LaTeX`

  - https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/LaTeX#How_to_turn_an_Inkscape_drawing_into_an_editable_LaTeX_document

Strange behavior: some packages (e.g. `blkarray`) are not found with `pdflatex` and `lualatex`. However, using `pdflatex` in the console works with the package. I do not know the reason for this problem. Possible explanation see [this issue](https://github.com/textext/textext/issues/48). Easy fix: Use `xelatex` instead and it will work. Maybe see if the problem still exists after a new installation of Inkscape and Textext.
